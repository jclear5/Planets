we want to destroy mars "Mars has a lack of human blood.  Cold and dry but everything is my 
favorite color. The two moons may be a problem for wolfman. But the 
mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity. Venus is a bit further away 
but no garlic or silver makes it an attractive choice. See further notes 
on Venus under venus.txt. "
